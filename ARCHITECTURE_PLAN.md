# App Migrator Unified Architecture Plan

## Current State: Integrated but Duplicated

### Duplicate Modules Found:
1. **Migration Engines:**
   - `enhanced_migration_engine.py` (OURS - Stable, v15 compatible)
   - `migration_engine.py` (GITHUB - Original)

2. **Schema Operations:**
   - `schema_fixer.py` (OURS - Database repair)
   - `database_schema.py` (GITHUB - Schema operations)

### Recommended Resolution:

#### Option 1: Keep Our Enhanced Versions as Primary
- Use `enhanced_migration_engine.py` as main migration engine
- Use `schema_fixer.py` for database operations  
- Keep GitHub modules as backup/reference
- Update commands to use our enhanced versions

#### Option 2: Merge Best of Both
- Merge features from GitHub into our enhanced versions
- Maintain our safety and v15 compatibility
- Add GitHub's advanced features to our base

## Decision: Option 1 (Keep Our Enhanced)

### Reasons:
1. Our versions have proven Frappe v15 compatibility
2. We've eliminated crash loops
3. Our testing suite validates our versions
4. Safety features are critical for production

### Implementation:
1. Ensure commands use our enhanced versions
2. Keep GitHub modules for reference/advanced use
3. Document the architecture clearly
